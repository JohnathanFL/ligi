(: Ligi also follows Zig's philosophy on manually managed resources
(: Given that, it also follows its path with regards to defer


let foo = fn -> void {
  var resource = someAllocatingFunc()
  defer resource.deinit()

  if someFunc() {
    (: deinit is called here
    return;
  }
  (: and here
}

(: Since Ligi doesn't follow Zig on error sets, we unfortunately don't have errdefer.
