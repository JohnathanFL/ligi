(: Feature proposal: Shorthand for creating enums

(: Doing enums like this is a little verbose when you only need the tags themselves:
let Foo = enum {
    enum en1, en2, en3
}

(: Instead, I plan to overload the enum operator to take a tuple of symbols like so:
let Bar = enum (en1, en2, en3)

(: This would then translate out to exactly the same as Foo before it.
(: This style wouldn't allow setting exact tag values (or changing tag types), but it is
(: shorter when only the tags are needed.
