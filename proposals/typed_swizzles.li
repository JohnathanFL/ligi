-- This is to allow the :type: spec in a swizzle


-- What we can already do:
let Vec3 = f64 * 3 + struct {}
let Vec2 = f64 * 2 + struct {}

let v3 = (:Vec3: 40, 41, 42)

-- New functionality:
var v2 = v3.(:Vec2: 0, 1)
-- In other words, you can specify the type that results from a swizzle

-- This could also be useful like:
let (a, b) = v2.(:bool, usize:
  bool_returning_func(),
  usize_returning_func()
)
-- Thus, you can cast things at the swizzle-site
