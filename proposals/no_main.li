-- This is to solidify what I've been thinking for a while w.r.t main functions


-- Essentially, I'll be removing the need for a "main" function altogether.
-- Things at the toplevel context are treated as the main function.
-- Thus, all variables in toplevels are essentially extracted into globals
-- and have their initializers run when their modules are imported
