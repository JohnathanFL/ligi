-- This is to try and track where I expect to allow type inference



-- Tuple sizes:
let (x, y, z): (f32, f32, f32)
-- can be written as
let (x, y, z): 3 * f32
-- or inferred as
let (x, y, z): _ * f32
-- this is useful for enums with many of the same type
let Meal = enum {
  enum (
    Breakfast,
    Lunch,
    Supper
  ): _ * f32 -- Makes all of them f32s
}
