-- This is to propose a "divrem" styled operator


-- Although the exact sigil is up in the air, it'd work like this:
let int1 = 11, int2 = 20
let (quotient, remainder) = int1 /% int2
assert quotient == 1 and remainder == 9

-- Some things:

-- Should it return a tuple or a struct? If it's a struct, it can be named. (quot, rem)
-- If it's a tuple, it can be easily destructured.
