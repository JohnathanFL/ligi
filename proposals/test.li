-- This is to document Ligi's testing style

-- Ligi shall follow Zig's example with builtin `test` blocks
-- The usage of test blocks and assert statements is heavily encouraged.

let adder = pure fn a, b -> c = a + b
-- The general syntax of a test is always `test` <testName> <block>
test "adder" {
  -- asserts are used within tests.
  -- A failed assert is the only way to fail a test.
  assert adder(4, 6) == 10
}


-- Update 07/26/20: New style. Since we now have `foo{}` macro call syntax,
-- we can't use `test str {}` as easily.
-- We'll change it to `test block`, where block can be labelled:
let #adder {
  assert adder(4, 6) == 10
}
