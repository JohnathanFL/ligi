The following is a checklist of things to be done in this repo for senior seminar:
- [x] EBNF grammar spec
  - Done, but may not be up to spec with some proposed changes in the `samples/` directory.
- [ ] Semantic language spec
  - Nearly done.
- [x] Lexer
- [x] Parser
- [x] Basic comptime evaluator
  - Absolute basics are in place, but a little more work is needed before I can
    consider it *completely* checked off (comptime math evaluation).
- [x] Basic comptime evaluator communicates with Ligujo
  - Currently only supports enum shorthand evaluation.
